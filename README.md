# slopspec

LLM-driven HEP analysis framework. An orchestrator agent delegates work to
subagents through five sequential phases, producing a publication-quality
analysis note.

## Quick start

```bash
pixi run scaffold analyses/my_analysis --type measurement
cd analyses/my_analysis
# Edit .analysis_config → set data_dir=/path/to/data, add allow= lines
pixi install
claude   # pass your physics prompt
```

## How it works

                                                             HUMAN GATE
```

Each phase runs the same loop:

```
  1. EXECUTE ── spawn executor subagent (enters plan mode first)
  2. REVIEW ─── spawn reviewer(s) per review type
  3. CHECK:
       Regression trigger? → Investigator → fix origin + downstream → resume
       A or B items?       → fix agent + fresh reviewer → re-review (loop)
       Only C items?       → PASS, executor applies Cs before commit
  4. COMMIT
  5. HUMAN GATE (after 4b for both measurements and searches)
  6. ADVANCE
```

### Phases

| Phase | Review | Key deliverable |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **1. Strategy** | 4-bot | Technique selection, systematic plan, reference analysis table, conventions enumeration |
| **2. Exploration** | Self | Sample inventory, data quality, variable ranking, preselection cutflow |
| **3. Processing** | 1-bot | Event selection, correction chain or background model, closure tests |
| **4a. Expected** | 4-bot | Systematic completeness table, covariance matrix, reference comparisons |
| **4b. 10% Validation** | 4-bot | 10% data results, draft AN with full structure, human gate |
| **4c. Full Data** | 1-bot | Full observed results, post-fit diagnostics |
| **5. Documentation** | 5-bot | Analysis note (pandoc markdown → PDF, 50-100 pages), machine-readable results |

Both measurements and searches follow the same 4a → 4b → 4c flow. The
human gate is between 4b and 4c.

### Review classification

| Cat | Meaning | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| **A** | Would cause rejection | Fix + re-review + fresh reviewer |
| **B** | Weakens the analysis | Same — must be zero before PASS |
| **C** | Style / clarity | Arbiter PASses; executor applies before commit |

Fresh reviewer added each iteration cycle. Limits: 4/5-bot warn at 3,
strong warn at 5, hard cap at 10. 1-bot warn at 2, escalate at 3.

### Phase regression

Any review can trigger regression when a physics issue is traceable to an
earlier phase. Most common after Phase 4a/4b and Phase 5 reviews.

```
Reviewer finds physics issue from Phase M < current Phase N
  → Investigator traces impact → REGRESSION_TICKET.md
  → Fix cycle: re-run Phase M, re-run affected downstream, skip unaffected
  → Resume review at Phase N
```

### Phase 5: 5-bot review

```
Physics + Critical (referee) + Constructive + Rendering (reads compiled PDF) + Arbiter
```

The rendering reviewer runs `pixi run build-pdf` and uses the Read tool to
visually inspect the PDF for figure rendering, math compilation, layout, and
cross-references.

## Key concepts

**Technique decided at Phase 1, not scaffold time.** The scaffolder only
takes `--type measurement|search`. The strategy phase selects the technique
(unfolding, template fit, etc.), which activates technique-specific
requirements in later phases.

**Conventions.** Domain knowledge in `src/conventions/` (symlinked into each
analysis). Mandatory reads at Phases 1, 4a, and 5. Updated after analysis
completion.

**Feasibility evaluation.** When hitting a limitation (missing MC, etc.),
agents must: state it → evaluate feasibility → estimate cost → decide
(attempt if it affects the core result, document if minor or infeasible) →
log the reasoning.

**Isolation.** A PreToolUse hook checks every file access against
`.analysis_config` (which lists `data_dir` and `allow=` paths). Symlinks
within the analysis dir (like `conventions/`) are allowed via logical path
checking.

**Pixi everywhere.** Each analysis has its own `pixi.toml` with deps and
tasks. `pixi run all` is the reproducibility contract. `pixi run build-pdf`
compiles the analysis note via pandoc.

## Directory structure

```
slopspec/
  src/                        Spec infrastructure
    methodology/              Full spec: phases, review, orchestration, appendices
    conventions/              Domain knowledge (symlinked into analyses)
    templates/                CLAUDE.md and pixi.toml templates
    scaffold_analysis.py      Scaffolder
  analyses/                   Each is its own git repo
    <name>/
      CLAUDE.md               ~570 lines — self-contained instructions
      pixi.toml               Environment + task graph
      .analysis_config        data_dir + allow paths for isolation hook
      conventions/ → src/conventions/
      phase{1..5}_*/          Phase dirs with CLAUDE.md, outputs/, src/, review/, logs/
```

## How scaffolding works

The scaffolder (`pixi run scaffold`) creates a new analysis directory from
templates in `src/templates/`:

1. **Template files** (`src/templates/root_claude.md`, `phase*_claude.md`,
   `pixi.toml`) are copied into the analysis directory with `{{name}}` and
   `{{analysis_type}}` placeholders replaced.
2. **Phase directories** (`phase1_strategy/`, `phase2_exploration/`,
   `phase3_selection/`, `phase4_inference/`, `phase5_documentation/`) are
   created with `outputs/`, `outputs/figures/`, `src/`, `review/`, and `logs/` subdirs.
3. **Conventions symlink** — `conventions/` → `../../src/conventions/` is
   created so agents can read domain knowledge.
4. **`.analysis_config`** is created with `analysis_type` set. Edit it to
   add `data_dir=` pointing to the input data.
5. **Git repo** is initialized in the analysis directory.

6. **Methodology symlink** — `methodology/` → `../../src/methodology/` is
   created so agents can consult the full methodology spec for detailed
   protocol definitions.

After scaffolding, the analysis directory is self-contained: its CLAUDE.md
files carry the essential instructions for execution. The full methodology
spec (`src/methodology/`) is also available via symlink for agents that need
detailed protocol definitions (review criteria, blinding protocol, etc.).

**How templates map to methodology:** Each template distills the relevant
methodology sections into execution-ready instructions:
- `root_claude.md` — §3 (phases), §6 (review, summary), §10 (scaling), §12 (feasibility)
- `phase1_claude.md` — §3 Phase 1, §6.4 review focus for strategy
- `phase2_claude.md` — §3 Phase 2, §5 (artifact format)
- `phase3_claude.md` — §3 Phase 3, §6.4 review focus for selection
- `phase4_claude.md` — §3 Phase 4, §4 (blinding), §6.4 review focus for inference
- `phase5_claude.md` — §3 Phase 5, §6.4.3 (documentation review), Appendix D (plotting)

## Requirements

- [pixi](https://pixi.sh) for environment management
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) as the agent runtime
